Project Introduction

The purpose of this project is to make a game of battlefield that you can play and compete against an AI of a certain difficulty.

System Overview

1. Create the board game map
2. Initialize the game for  bot & human
3. Let people initialize map while bot initialize map randomly (I think randomly is the best way to initialize map)
4. Accept player's request through terminal
5. Make bot's algorithm by statistics (finding out the odd of each position on player's board by how many ways can boats fit that position)
6. Randomly choose the "best move" by randomly choose out of highest odd position

Possible Challenges

1. Lack of experience of making AIs
2. How to make the bot determine what is a good move (battleship is a game that is also based in luck)
